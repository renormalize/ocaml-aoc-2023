# Advent of Code 2023 in OCaml

Each day's solution functions are in its corresponding directory.
The bin directory contains `dayXbin.ml` files which invoke the solution functions.

To run a particular day's solutions, run:

```bash
dune exec day_integer
```

For example, to run day 1's solutions, run:

```bash
dune exec 1
```
